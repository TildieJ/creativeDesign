Highway Man is a high-speed script typeface with an intense, fast-moving style. 

Its bold strokes and slanted letters create a sense of momentum, making it perfect for themes of adventure and rebellion. The unique horizontal motion lines running over the text makes it as if the characters are rushing forward on a highway.

With nods to vintage automotive culture and classic racing aesthetics while being inherently progressive, Highway Man carries both a retro and modern appeal.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

The font is created by Mans Greback with direct inspiration from the typographic work of Dan Cassaro.
